ml router

to train - run train_network.py, it will train on tileset (pickle file) hardcoded in train_router function

to evaluate it on generated tiled design - run new training and see new file in ./images folder

to evaluate it on generated design, run evaluate.py and uncomment lines

to evaluate it on benchmark, run evaluate.py

to generate tiles, run generate_trainset.py

for different experiments, call appropriate function from train_network.py
